Hello!
==========================
I'm Lowe Wilsson, currently employed as a research assistant at Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm. There, I develop experiments with the Python package [PsychoPy](https://psychopy.org/) (here's an [example](https://github.com/datalowe/psychopy-smdt-melody)) and do data analysis using R and Python. I'm also in the process of finishing up a database migration from Filemaker to REDCap with data from a twin study. In addition to this I've had the opportunity to make use of Python and R tools for web scraping, generating audio and more.

Parallel to work I am intensely studying subjects related to programming, math and statistics. I've taken courses at Swedish universities these past two years in among other things linear algebra, Python and web development. Apart from taking courses I do a lot of self-study. One of the topics I've delved into is web development with the framework/Python package [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/). I've set up a Linode server which is now serving my personal blog, built with Django, at [datalowe.com](https://datalowe.com/).

I'm also a licensed psychologist.
