Analysis 2: Page speeds
==================
This report presents and comments on results from evaluating website loading speeds with the tools Google Pagespeed Insight and Firefox Devtools.

Sample selection
-----------------------
Three web sites that were expected to have issues, based on age, the web site not being the primary focus of the company/individual or limited resources, with page speeds were included in order to gather as much data as possible about causes behind page speed issues and what might cause them. The following pages were picked:

* [こはる日和 - koharu biyori](http://daijyoyuukoharu.blog62.fc2.com/), a Japanese cat blog. Japanese web sites often have designs that visually would appear outdated within a European context, but that doesn't mean that the performance is bad or that there's anything objectively oudated about the sites. Being a cat blog however increases the risk of the site having little resources for optimized performance.

* [La yaya costurera](http://www.layayacosturera.com/), the website of a Catalan/Spanish tailor shop chain operating in Barcelona and Madrid, which presents information on where their shops are located and the services they offer. The web site appears to have been worked on quite a lot design-wise, but it's possible that page speed has received less attention since potential customers are not expected to visit the site often.

* [Karolinska Sjukhuset](https://www.karolinska.se/?splitoption=splitdecision), a website for part of the public health services in Stockholm, Sweden, which includes a multitude of hospitals and clinics. Karolinska Sjukhuset has been locally ridiculed following its decisions related to public spending and employing contractors. It is expected then that work related to web design and maintenance might also bring issues with it.

Method
-----------------------
Each website is initially visited and browsed around on for a few minutes to get a general feel for whether the site is experienced as slow or smooth. Following this, the front page and two additional pages are selected for deeper analysis. The three pages are run against Google Page Insights and with the help of Firefox Devtools, network traffic data are collected. Results are compiled in a Google Sheet.
