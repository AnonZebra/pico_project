Analysis 3: Principles of design
==================
This report presents and comments on results from analysing the design and application of design principles on three personal sites, i. e. where each site is created by and presents a specific person. An additional aim is to compare the picked sites with the author's own portfolio page.

Sample selection
-----------------------
Since a subgoal was to find material which compared with the author's page, [seddonym.me/](https://seddonym.me/), the site of David Seddon], a Python/Django developer, was chosen as a fairly similar site from someone not focused on design.

In order to include more varied and design-focused pages, two sites were picked using a [random number generator](https://www.random.org/) from a [listing of recommended personal websites](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/best-personal-websites):
* [garicruze.com](https://www.garicruze.com/)
* [kendraschaefer.com](http://kendraschaefer.com/)

Method
-----------------------
Sites were first viewed by the author to get a subjective feel of them. They were then analyzed from the viewpoint of design principles as described in Beaird and George's book, "The principles of beautiful web design"[1], [2]. To decrease time spent looking things up in the book, a [design principles article from canva.com](https://www.canva.com/learn/design-elements-principles/) [3] was used as a handy reference.

Results and analysis of each site
-----------------------
### seddonym.me
The site aims to give a brief description of the author and how to reach him, but the main focus is really on content that he produces himself in the form of blog posts and recorded talks. As you visit the site, you quickly notice that he uses a near-achromatic design, with everything in black, white or grey apart from blue emphasizing elements that are in focus/hovered over and image elements which are always in full color. It's a stripped-down, high-contrast design with focus on the content, and this goal is mostly achieved.

Blog posts and talks are both presented in the same way, a list of 'cards' split into an introductory text and a single image, using repetition to communicate cohesion and contrasting texts against images.

On desktop, the sidebar is always present and does not shrink, meaning the layout is very consistent but also doesn't adjust to different page requirements. On all pages other than the start page, a large left-pointing arrow appears beside the link back to the start page on the side bar, directing the user. Scale is also used to make the start page (and the author's name) stand out. The ever-present sidebar and its arrow become a bit distracting at first when reading longer blog posts and contributes to relatively little horizontal space being left for the post content itself. The line length ends up being about 45-50 characters, meaning you have to scroll quite a bit on desktop. Another factor contributing to the narrow text area is that the single image accompanying the blog post gets a column of its own, with a text:image column size ratio of 7:5. This makes for a lot of somewhat awkward negative space once you scroll past the image, making the page feel unbalanced.

In general, the site doesn't need to and doesn't do anything fancy design-wise. It could improve a few things but the design mostly does what it seems to be intended to - not getting in the way of the content.

### garicruze.com
The site aims to serve as a portfolio of the author's past advertising/copywriting projects. It relies on images from these past projects to liven up the site, making the start page feel very splashy and vibrant. Lines are used to subtly accent navbar links that are in focus/hovered over. Scale and a contrasting typography is used to make the author's name and start page link stand out. The effect when hovering over one of the projects' images is more dramatic, with a zoom-in effect creating a sense of depth, project title popping up and the image becoming darkened. The site is clearly directing the user's attention toward the portfolio's project descriptions. The project descriptions themselves are very focused on visual presentation in the form of images, and a short description on the side. The start page minimizes negative space by creating a collage out of the various project's images where images are arranged in a tightly grouped grid, no matter what the screen size is. The images are very varied, increasing contrast, but the tight grouping and similar presentation/repetition makes them still feel connected.

The site succeeds in drawing the user's attention to the author's projects and his (and/or his teams') work.

### kendraschaefer.com
This is mainly a blog site but also includes [Kendra Schaefer's portfolio](http://kendraschaefer.com/some-stuff-i-once-made/) and an about page. It seems to try to make the reader intrigued about who the writer really is, and especially about the work they do. As you visit the site it looks like a retro-style blog, with a typewriter font used for headers as well as things like contact information, and a sepia-like background color. Red is used as an accent color. The site breaks a lot of user expectations and creates a sense of randomness, such as when you click the menu expansion icon at the top and you're presented with a huge area of negative space and just two typewriter font text links. Blog posts' pages have a simple, easy-to-read design.

The site does make the reader intrigued. Apart from that, the site doesn't seem to have a clear goal other than serving as a platform for various thoughts the author has and as such it's hard to judge how effective the site is in doing what it aims to do.

Summary
-----------------------
The three sites had very different approaches to design. The first one tried to keep things as simple and muted as possible, the second went for a more sprawling, lively design, and the third went for a retro and deceivingly unpolished look. All sites used, predictably, repetition for presenting items of content. All sites had a good deal of negative space except for the start page of garicruze.com (though it does keep the header, which does have negative space, around even as you scroll). This prevents making the sites feel cramped. Cruze's and Schaefer's sites try to surprise the user but in very different ways, the first one using vibrant images and the later breaking expectations on how a site should work. They all subscribe to having a main navigation bar that's easy to reach, and always keeping the link to the start page around. This increases consistency, gives a sense of hierarchy, and directs the user on how to make their way around. All three sites use a limited color palette, while the images they use are more varied and eye-catching. Apart from Cruze's 'zoom-in effect', the sites don't make much use of movement or depth, mostly using flat designs.

Addendum: Self-reflection
-----------------------
Based on the above analysis, I'll now make some reflections about my own site, the very one you're reading right now. The design overall makes use of primarily two colors apart from black and white, with a third color visible here and there. This third, purple, color doesn't always work that well on top of the primary background color. Hexagons are used as a recurring element when presenting items of content, including within content pages' sidebars - however, this doesn't work as well when the content pieces are long and/or there aren't many content pieces in the same category. It creates some sense of depth through the use of shadows added to content pieces and shadows appearing when the user hovers over content piece hexagons. and has different layouts for different pages, though the header and footer act as anchors common for all pages. On the reports page, there's a clear usage of scale, where the final project's hexagon is larger than the others.

![screenshot of this website's 'Reports' page, showing different-size hexagons](%base_url%/image/website_snaps/portfolio_reports.png&width=800)

There's no clear general direction to the site, leaving it up to the user to decide where to go after the portfolio page. On individual content pages, like this one, a background color gradient as well as a border color gradient is used to create a sense of direction within the page. There is a limited use of images other than in the gallery and within content pieces, which might make the site's general design appear more boring than something like garicruze.com.

Design principles that I haven't used a lot or at all but that could help make the site more appealing would be:

**Repetition and texture**: I could put in some more repetition of elements. I had heard about using repeating patterns on the [Syntax podcast](https://syntax.fm/show/196/design-foundations-for-developers), where they recommended using [heropatterns.com](https://www.heropatterns.com/) and so I did. I've now added a subtle hexagon pattern to the header and footer to add texture.

**Symmetry and balance**: The images in the gallery didn't always have the same height, only the same width, meaning they were uneven. I've now changed the parameters to CImage so that cropping is used, ensuring that all images have the same height.

**Transparency and direction**: I could try adding some additional background elements and using gradual decrease in transparency to make them point toward something, but I'm not sure what/where that would be at the moment.

**Randomness and emphasis**: To make the site more interesting and less uniform I could try using a different shape (non-hexagonal) for certain important elements, but again, I'm not sure what that would be right now. I could also add some very faint random background clutter on the start page, but it might become too messy even if it's not very pronounced.

**Movement and depth**: I could make elements more interactive by having them appear to move within or out of the plane. I've made the navbar links transition to their active color and also added a stark shadow to the active state, which gives them a comic book-like feel. It's not movement per se, but to make the gallery a bit more responsive, similar to garicruze.com, I added an effect where all images are grayscale until focused on by the user (except if the screen is small, in which case I assume the user doesn't have a mouse to hover with/keyboard to focus with).

**Typography**: I didn't really want to change the fonts, but to add more variation to the site I've changed the navbar links to be in all uppercase, making them even more similar to comic book text when active.

Something I would like to do is change how the sidebar behaves on the analysis pages, to prevent the awkward spacing between the hexagons on longer pages. What I would like to do is have a set sidebar height for all analysis pages, rather than having the height be flexible. The sidebar's scrollbar would then be 'paced differently' than the main area. So for example, if the sidebar is 1600 px tall, and the content area is 10000 px tall, then if you scroll down to 5000px in the main content area, the sidebar would have scrolled to 800px. It's hard to describe and I don't know how to do this.
