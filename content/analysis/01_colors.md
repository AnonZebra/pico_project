Analysis 1: Colors & fonts
==================
This report aims to describe qualitative analyses and evaluations of color and font choices for three different web pages.

Sample selection
-----------------------
The author emphasized breadth when selecting a sample of web sites for analysis. The following three company pages were picked:

[Mediamarkt](https://www.mediamarkt.de/), a multinational store chain focused on media and IT. The company's German page is examined. The hypothesis is that they use a stripped-down design to shift focus towards the products, price tags and search functionality. Colors are predicted to be intense to catch buyers' attention, similar to how traditional discount signs in bright colors and bold fonts communicate urgency and great deals.

[Karlskoga Tidning](https://www.karlskogatidning.se/), a local newspaper for Karlskoga, a small town where I grew up. Hypotheses are that the magazine has a relatively low budget for web design and that it focuses on presenting a lot of information, with a sober stripped down design. Fonts are predicted to focus on high readability, while text-background contrast is maximized and the color palette is monochromatic or complementary (bichromatic).

[MET Museum](https://www.metmuseum.org/), one of the most famous museums in the world that places great emphasis on how they are perceived. It is expected that their page would be highly edited and seeks to give prominence to both the museum's objects as well as their own image. As the goal is to attract visitors, and the museum's products themselves are very aesthetic, it is predicted that the site explores more varied aesthetics in web design as well. It is possible then that their color palette varies between pages, but it's also possible that they want to give weight to brand/logo colors, so no hypothesis is made about color choices. Fonts are expected to focus on appealing but sparse designs for longer object descriptions, for example, while they may use more prominent fonts for links or titles.

Method
-----------------------
All pages are first visited in an attempt to "role-play" a typical user with an intended goal (eg go to Mediamarkt to buy a USB memory) and the following is noted

1. What first catches the attention of the user
2. If the user feels like doing something other than what they came for
3. How easy or difficult it is for the user to navigate to their goal
4. If the page is subjectively perceived as ugly or appealing
5. How fonts / color play into the above

Then all the colors on the start page are written for subsequent analysis of what the web designer(s) may have intended to use as primary, secondary and/or tertiary color. Fonts are noted and reviewed in a similar way.

All pages are input to [Color Combos' tool for extracting the colors used on a website](https://www.colorcombos.com) to reduce the risk of missing any relevant colors. For designs that are polychromatic, Adobe's [color wheel tool](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel) is used to map the colors and visualize how they relate to each other.

Results and analysis for each site
-----------------------

    <li class="color-bar" style="background-color: #df0000">
    <li class="color-bar" style="background-color: #272422">
</ul>
#### Fonts

* **MMHeadline**
    - Used for headings. Sans-serif. Used with high font weight/bold style.
* **SourceSansPro**
    - Used for descriptions, information and smaller link texts. Sans serif.

#### Analysis
Mediamarkt's site turned out to fit well with expectations. Their site is primarily monochromatic, using red apart from black or white. ![Media Markt Screenshot](%base_url%/image/website_snaps/mediamarkt_1.png&width=800) The contrasts between colors is stark, using a slightly darker shades of red sparingly, such as for the very top banner and otherwise using perfect white and near-perfect black. They use red text as a way to highlight discounts. Since they are doing Black Friday week offers now they are temporarily using black on top of red in a similar way to signal discounts to customers. As the site is visited, attention is drawn toward these very Black Friday offers, but it's also easy to find the search bar which stands out in white against its red surroundings. The fonts are simple, easy to read and with bold style often used for emphasis. There's no strong reason to use a serif font since customers aren't expected to spend a lot of time reading on the site, and the site wants to seem modern and hi-tech, rather than say having a long history. The company has had its own header font made to reinforce their own brand.

### Karlskoga Tidning

#### Fonts

* **Open Sans**
    - The only font used on the whole website, whether it be headers, article text or links. Sans serif. Bold font is used for headings and some links.

#### Analysis
Karlskoga Tidning's site uses a wider range of colors than expected. The reason for this is that the colors are used for marking articles according to which category they belong to, helping users navigate. The colors appear to have been chosen to be as different from each other as possible. Colors are used sparingly however, mostly as thin borders of items of content. The primary color used seems to be the green color, even though it doesn't feature in the company's logo. ![Karlskoga Tidning Screenshot](%base_url%/image/website_snaps/karlskoga-tidning-1.png) Surprisingly, only one font is used on the whole site, which makes it harder to differentiate article text from headers. Articles are mostly short, but readability is still a bit damaged by the same sans serif font being used everywhere. Attention isn't clearly drawn anywhere on the first page, since nothing is particularly highlighted. Attention shifts between the navbar links, the 'jumping' log in icon, the ad banner at the top and the bigger (but cut by the fold&width=800) image at the bottom.

### The MET museum
#### Color profile

    <li class="color-bar" style="background-color: #e4002b">
    <li class="color-bar" style="background-color: #272422">
</ul>

#### Fonts

* **MetSans**
    - The only font used on the whole website. Sans serif. Bolding is used for headings and information such as dates.

#### Analysis
![MET museum screenshot](%base_url%/image/website_snaps/met-1.png&width=800)
The MET museum goes for a monochromatic design, but are much more restricted in their use of the red color in comparison to Mediamarkt. The emphasis is on the content and what the museum has to offer in terms of objects to view and activities to do. For buttons they use gradients to soften the contrast against the white background. Upon hovering over the buttons they light up, and navbar dropdown menus' choices slightly darken, making the site more interactive in a non-obtrusive way. Also contrary to expectations, the site uses a single in-house font, which makes the site appear more uniform and again increases focus on images and other content on the site, rather than the site's own colors or fonts. Upon viewing the first page, attention is drawn towards the splashing 'trailer reel' welcoming the user to visit the museum in person, while it's clear how to find what's needed through the navbar at the top, including a search icon, though it is less pronounced compared to Mediamarkt, likely because it is less pivotal to the Museum's services.

Conclusions
-----------------------
Sites were found to be much more restrictive in fonts they used than expected. This is probably in order to not distract users from what is being marketed, as all the sites chosen had one thing in common which was that their main product/service isn't the site itself, rather it's a means to an end. One could argue that this wouldn't be the case for Karlskoga Tidning, but their centre of attention is still print newspapers, a luxury and a curse of being a local newspaper on a limited budget and scarce goings-on.

The use of colors was also less frivolous than expected, in that the site that used the most disparate colors had very little of them and the MET went for a monochromatic design. This provides for a style that's easier to maintain and is perhaps perceived as being cleaner and more mature. Mediamarkt very clearly makes use of red color to accentuate their products, almost aggressively pushing them on the user, and other colors would detract from this effect. The MET seems to bet on images and video catching users' interest. Karlskoga Tidning has no clear overall approach to their design, which might be sign of neglect in favor of the print medium, or of users generally being older and having little concern for the design as long as the contrast is good enough and the articles aren't overly annoying to reach.
