About this website
==================
This website is built using:

* [Pico](http://picocms.org/about/), a minimalistic Content Management System.
* [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/), a CSS pre-processor which enables use of variables and much more
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Node package manager](https://www.npmjs.com/) - node is actually a JavaScript runtime and isn't really used in itself on the website, but its package manager is used for managing and running Sass
