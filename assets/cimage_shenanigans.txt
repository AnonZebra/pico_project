to start making apache serve the site I ran `sudo vim /etc/apache2/httpd.conf` and
edited the file like so:
```
#DocumentRoot "/Library/WebServer/Documents"
#<Directory "/Library/WebServer/Documents">

Define rootDir /Users/lowe/Sites/design/me/portfolio
DocumentRoot "${rootDir}"
<Directory "${rootDir}">
```
(I first tried with the original portfolio directory, but that became too convoluted
because I would probably have to change the whole chain of directories' read/write
permissions. Hence I created a new copy of the portfolio directory using
`dbwebb clone design`, `cd design && mkdir me/portfolio` and then `dbwebb download portfolio`)




first issue I bumped into was that the folder cache/cimage/fasttrack didn't exist (and couldn't be created by the Apache user).
after creating the fasttrack folder, CImage complained that it didn't have write access.
so I did a `sudo chown _www:_www cache/cimage`. after this, I could go directly to the
address for img.php with GET parameters specifying an image and conversion parameters.
however, the redirection didn't work as expected, meaning there was probably
something wrong with the .htaccess file, or how it was being used.
In '/etc/apache2/httpd.conf' I changed AllowOverride so that I then had (for the directory I'm using)
```
 #    AllowOverride None
     AllowOverride All
```
To use Apache's rewrite module I also had to uncomment
```
LoadModule rewrite_module libexec/apache2/mod_rewrite.so
```
Finally, things seem to be working. I reach the site by simply visiting 'localhost' through
the browser.
